# CustomerSegmentation-KMeans (May2020)

Bank Customer Segmentation using KMeans

-Kmeans Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Leaning Algorith.
-It is used to cluster data in 'k' number of clusters.
-Initially k different centroids are indentified and every data point is allocated to the nearest Centroids.
-After allocating the data points a new centroid is calculated for each cluster.
-This new centroid for each cluster is selected such that it minimizes the distance between the centroid and every other data point in that cluster.
