# CustomerSegmentation-KMeans (May2020)

Bank Customer Segmentation using KMeans
<ul>
  <li>Kmeans Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Leaning Algorithm.</li>
  <li>It is used to cluster data in 'k' number of clusters.</li>
  <li>Initially k different centroids are indentified and every data point is allocated to the nearest Centroids.</li>
  <li>After allocating the data points a new centroid is calculated for each cluster.</li>
  <li>This new centroid for each cluster is selected such that it minimizes the distance between the centroid and every other data point in that cluster.</li>
</ul>
